i have added functions: findindex(),combineindices(),combineindices2(),findlines()
first 2 are of no use, made them but while running, they were causing a lot of lag.
in 3rd funtion,
	it tries to find contour from both sides of hand
	and then, in the 4th function,
	it tries to see hand as a set of 3 vertical lines, one-from wrist to one side of thumb,
 	other which is contour of other side of hand, 3rd-consisting of contours of our 4 fingers
	last 2 make up other side of hand while first is one side of hand
	differentiation between one side of hand and other side of hand is done using standard deviation
	we have to see which value works.
	line1, line2, line 3 are mean x coordinates of these lines.
	flag determines whether hand is left facing or right facing
	then, this is added to history which keeps track of how much hand has moved till now	
	and then checking if standard deviation is small in currindex==5, to see if there is no motion
	 there will be a similar check for 10 and 15
	at 18, we are going to look if side of hand has changed, i.e. whether it was at first left facing and is now right facing
	at 18 i am thinking of also adding covariance check to see if it is really a gesture or some haphazard hand movement.
