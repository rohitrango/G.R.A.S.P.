basically we will want to open such things for which we don't require keyboard or mouse later on..

1.	Watching a movie on vlc
		-increasing/decreasing volume
		-fast forward
		-toggle between full screen and normal screen
		-pause/play

2.	Opening youtube
		-switching songs
		-starting from last played song
		-increasing/decreasing volume
		-toggle between full screen and normal screen
		-pause/play

3.	opening chrome
		-opening facebook page directly
			-opening/closing the notifications tab
		-opening gmail(of course already signed in account)

4.	opening terminal
		-I haven't found any use as of now(As ultimately you have to use keyboard)
		-Maybe update and upgrade can be done with a gesture

5.	open camera
		-take video or picture using different gestures
		-Of course we have to implement for pause/play/stop for video recording

6.	Take screenshot
		-toggle between grabbing the particular window or the entire screen

7.  Open firefox
		- some default pages opening up

I have come up with these many.. Do edit if you get more!
